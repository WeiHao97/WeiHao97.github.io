# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #
I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science department at Columbia University, co-advised by Prof.[Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/) and Prof.[Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/).

I received my B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Dec 2019. At Madison, I was advised by Prof.[Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/). I also worked closely with Prof.[Jonathan Mace](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~jcmace/) at MPI-SWS.

My current interest lies in the intersection of Systems and Machine Learning. I believe that ML system is not only just a new use case for existing systems, but also requires novel features to accommodate MLâ€™s statistical and computation-intensive nature. I am excited to build smart, scalable and safe ML systems for next generation. Please [contact](mailto:wei<dot>h<at>columbia<dot>edu) me if you want to collaborate.
