I was an undergraduate student, double majoring in CS and Math at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I graduated in Dec 2019. I was advised by Prof.[Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) on ML Systsems and by Prof.[Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/) on Machine Learning.

I will be a PhD student at Columbia starting in 2020 Fall, co-advised by Prof.[Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/) and Prof.[Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/).

My current interest lies in the intersection of System and Machine Learning. I believe that ML system is not only just a new use case for existing systems, but also requires novel features to accommodate MLâ€™s statistical and computation-intensive nature. I am excited to build energy efficient, scalable and safe ML systems for next generation.
