I will join the Computer Science department at Columbia University as a PhD student co-advised by Prof.[Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/) and Prof.[Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/),starting from 2020 Fall.

I received my B.S. degree in CS and Math from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Dec 2019. At Madison, I was advised by Prof.[Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) on ML Systsems and by Prof.[Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/) on Machine Learning.

My current interest lies in the intersection of Systems and Machine Learning. I believe that ML system is not only just a new use case for existing systems, but also requires novel features to accommodate MLâ€™s statistical and computation-intensive nature. I am excited to build smart, scalable and safe ML systems for next generation. Please [contact](mailto:wei<dot>h<at>columbia<dot>edu) me if you want to collaborate.
