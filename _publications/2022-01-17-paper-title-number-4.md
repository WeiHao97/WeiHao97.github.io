In this paper, We Constructed an evasive adversarial attack that targets adapted models on the edge while being virtually undetectable by the original models which typically serves as the authoritative model version. Our attack is 1.9-4.2 times more likely not to be detected by the original model but only 1.7-3.6% worse on attacking the adapted model compared to PGD attack.
