This paper talks about a novel trainable network diffusion model that infers the propagation dynamics of amyloid pathology, which conditioned on individual-level structural connectivity network. The proposal model on longitudinal amyloid pathology estimates in 16 gray matter (GM) regions known to be affected by AD (N = 112) individuals, measured using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography at 3 different time points for each subject. Experiments show that proposal model outperforms inference based on group-level trends for predicting future time points data (using individual-level structural connectivity network). For group-level analysis, there are significant group parameter differences (via permutation testing) between APOE positive and APOE negative subjects.
